# big_package chef cookbook

Installs extra packages that don't warrant their own cookbook (tree, htop,
colordiff and so on), yet still provides visibility, dev-vs-production
tradeoffs, and fine-grained version control where necessary.

## Overview

All but the most hermetic production machines benefit from certain base
packages -- git, htop, libxml, etc -- be present. Creating a stupid one-line
cookbook for each is overkill and clutters your runlist. Having a fixed
'big_dumping_ground_for_packages' is a proven disaster -- one coder's
convenience gems is anothers' bundler hell.

Package sets provide
* visibility: I know *exactly* which miscellaneous packages are installed
* package sets are repeatable and match the machine's purpose: dev boxes get a
  variety of kitchen sinks, production boxes get only bare essentials.
* Fine-grained control over versions, and ability to knock out a conflicting
  package.
  
### Choosing package sets

The pkg_sets attribute group defines what package sets to install, and the
contents of those package sets.

Choose the package sets to install by setting `node[:pkg_sets][:install]`. The
default is

    default[:pkg_sets][:install] = %w[ base dev sysadmin ]

Targets for `package` resource go in `node[:pkg_sets][:pkgs][{set_name}]`,
targets for `gem_package` go in `node[:pkg_sets][:gems][{set_name}]`, and so
forth. For instance, the 'base' group is defined as

    default[:pkg_sets][:pkgs][:base] = %w[ tree git zip openssl ]
    default[:pkg_sets][:gems][:base] = %w[ bundler rake ]

In your clusters file or a role, you can both specify which sets (if any) the
machine installs, and modify (for that node or role only) what packages are
in any given group.

Defining pkg_sets is distributed -- anything can define a 'foo' group by
setting `node[:pkg_sets][:pkgs][:foo]`, no need to modify this
cookbook. Selecting *which* packages to install is however unambiguous -- you
must expressly add the set 'foo' to your node[:pkg_sets][:install] attribute.
