h2. Top Priorities

* *Role discovery* sucks right now -- broham = weak, too much setup, ick
** Make broham a webservice in front of pluggable backend?
** Get people's blessing that cluster_service_discovery is a good impl.
* *Documentation*: moar plz.
* *Videocast*: a visual walkthrough would help adoption
* *Bootstrap*: bless a minimal bootstrap method
** Should we use packages or scripts?
* *ChefHadoopNfsMaster*: smoother instantiation of a standalone (starter) cluster.
** chef server walkthrough could use work

h2. Cloud / Local

* *EBS volume creation*: create, attach, format, populate databag
** Make sure 
* *Local cluster*: separate out cloud code to work with local code
* *Rackspace & other clouds*: Abstract out EC2-specific codes
* *JClouds*: 

h2. Hadoop

* *Tuning* for generic node -- is EC2-specific tuning necessary?
* *Admin tasks*
** Make namenode formatting safe
** recipe to do namenode metadata backup?
* *EBS attachment* = still shaky
* *Secondary Namenode on non-master*: Right now it's really hard to do something like 'make one slave also be the 2NN'. This should be easy
* *Patched version*: this is still hard

h2. Azkaban

* runit script flapping

h2. Zookeeper

* Need scripts
** cluster discovery integration?

h2. Cassandra

* runit script flapping
* Newer point version
* cassandra shouldn't start before the /etc/cassandra is present

h2. HBase

* Need scripts
** cluster discovery

h2. Bugs

* Complain if the validation.pem (etc) is missing
