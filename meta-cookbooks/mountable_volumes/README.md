# mountable_volumes chef cookbook

Mount volumes as directed by node metadata, and coordinate use of those volumes by other cookbooks.

## Overview

Cookbooks want to know not just what volumes are available, but their logical purpose: 'scratch space', 'persistent', 'super-fast flash-drive storage'. The details of that mapping shouldn't be their concern, only to request those resources and use them responsibly.

This meta-cookbook coordinates the machine's aspect of having various volumes and various systems cookbooks' concern of allocating storage on them.
