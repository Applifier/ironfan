h2. Setting up Firefox for proxied access to the hadoop consoles

I use multiple Firefox instances, so that I can run one with just the EC2 plugins and keep my main browser lightweight.  Instructions are here: http://bit.ly/manyfoxen courtesy John Resig. In a nutshell, you're going to make two copies of the program, and choose the profile each time you start.

h3. Install Add-ons

* FoxyProxy: From the *Tolls/Add-ons* menu, search for 'FoxyProxy', install same.  (You want the full version, not the basic).
* S3Fox: From the *Tolls/Add-ons* menu, search for 'S3Fox', install same
* ElasticFox is **not** available through the Add-ons menu.  Instead,
** visit http://bit.ly/elasticfox
** Hit 'Download'
** Select "Allow" from the permissions ribbon at the top of the browser window
** Pick "Install"

Now restart Firefox.

h3. S3Fox

Launch S3Fox from Tools / S3 Organizer.  Hit 'Manage Accounts'. Give some sensible label for the account name, and enter your  AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY.

h3. ElasticFox

Launch S3Fox from Tools / ElasticFox.  When prompted, give some sensible label for the account name, and enter your AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY.

It will take a noticeable amount of time for the plugin to populate.

h3. FoxyProxy

From Tools / Add-ons, select FoxyProxy and hit its Preferences button.
* Set mode to 'Use Proxies based on their pre-defined patterns and priorities"
* Add New Proxy:
** Under Proxy Details, select 'Automatic Proxy configuration URL'
** in the text box that follows, paste in http://github.com/infochimps/cluster_chef/raw/master/config/proxy.pac
** Hit test just to check.
** Under 'URL Patterns', whitelist these:
  <notextile>
  *://10.*
  *ec2*.amazonaws.com*
  *ec2.internal*
  *domu*.internal*
  *compute*.internal*
  </notextile>
  
** Under 'URL Patterns', blacklist the URL pattern
  <notextile>
  https://us-*st-1.ec2.amazonaws.com/*
  </notextile>
  
** Under 'General', name the proxy 'Hadoop Cluster Proxy'
** Hit OK to add the proxy. YAY.
* Finally, go to the 'Global Settings' tab and check 'Use SOCKS proxy for DNS lookups'. Let Firefox restart.
