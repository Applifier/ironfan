h3. Tradeoffs of EBS-backed volumes

Be careful of the tradeoffs with EBS-backed volumes.

* _good_: You can start and stop instances -- don't pay for the compute from the end of that hour until you restart.
* _good_: It's way easier to tune up an AMI. (Then again, chef makes much of that unnecessary)
* _good_: You can make the volume survive even if the node is terminated (spot price is exceeded, machine crashes, etc).
* _good_: You can make a persistent HDFS without having to fart around attaching EBS volumes at startup. There are performance tradeoffs, though.
* _bad_: The disk is noticably slower. Make sure to point tempfiles and scratch space to the local drives. (The scripts currently handle most but not all of this).
* _bad_: The root volume counts against your quota for EBS volumes.
* _bad_: Starting more than six or so EBS-backed instances can cause AWS to shit a brick allocating all the volumes.

Refer to the standard setups described above.

h2. Recommended cluster composition

We're going to target these two plausible cluster setups:

h3. Small, simple cluster ("Zaius")

A modest, no-fuss cluster to get started:

* Master node acts as chef server, nfs server, hadoop master (namenode, secondarynamenode and jobtracker), hadoop worker.
* 0-5 worker nodes: nfs client, hadoop worker.
* All nodes are EBS-backed instances, sized large enough to hold the HDFS.
* Use non-spot pricing, but manage costs by starting/stopping instances when not in use. (Set 'ebs_delete_on_termination' to false and 'disable-api-termination' to true)

h3. Industrial-strength cluster with persistent HDFS ("Maximus")

A many-node cluster that can be spot priced (or frequently launched/terminated); uses persistent EBS volumes for the HDFS (much more efficient than S3).

* A standalone EBS-backed small instance acting as the chef server and nfs server. Can start/stop when not in use (set 'ebs_delete_on_termination' false and 'disable-api-termination' true) or use a reserved instance.
* Spot-priced master node (namenode, secondarynamenode and jobtracker) that is also a hadoop worker, nfs client, and cassandra node.
* 6-40 spot-priced worker nodes: hadoop worker, nfs client, cassandra node.
* All nodes are local-backed instances with EBS volumes attached at startup.
* You can shut down the cluster (or tolerate EC2 shutting it down if the spot price spikes) without harm to the HDFS. The NFS home dir lets you develop scripts on a small cluster and only spin up the big cluster for production jobs.
* For a larger cluster, you can turn off worker roles for the master node, and can specify the namenode and jobtracker to reside on different machines.
* You can specify any scale of instance depending on whether your job is IO-, CPU- or memory-intensive, and size master and worker nodes independently.

h2. Prerequisites

You should already be familiar with hadoop and with the Amazon cloud.  These scripts are meant to efficiently orchestrate many dependent packages, and the bugs are still being straightened out.

* Choose a name for your cluster. In this example, we'll use 'zaius' for the small cluster and 'maximus' for the big cluster.
* Visit the "aws console":http://bit.ly/awsconsole and ensure you're registered for EC2 and SimpleDB. (You may have to click through a license agreement and check your email)
* Choose your availability zone (spot pricing in the US-East-1 region seems to be the lowest). You *must* set all machines in the cluster to the same availability zone.
* Chef needs a good, durable domain name. Allocate an elastic IP; have your DNS server point both 'chef.yourdomain.com' and 'zaius.yourdomain.com' at that elastic IP.

From now on, I'm going to just use 'chef.yourdomain.com', 'zaius' and 'maximus' without apology, but substitute accordingly.
