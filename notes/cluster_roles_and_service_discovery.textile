h2. Notes

h3. On cluster restart: clear chef client and broham registration

After spinning down/starting up your cluster, if you use role-based names (zaius-slave-0 etc) you need to do
<pre><code>
  knife client bulk-delete 'zaius-.*'
  broham-unregister 'zaius-.*'
</code></pre>
(Use a more limited regex if some of those are still alive!) Chef won't authenticate a client if one already exists for that name.
