h2. Play around with single-machine server

If you're using HDFS on the ephemeral drives, put the hadoop_cluster::format_namenode_once and hadoop_cluster::std_hdfs_dirs recipe in below hadoop and before hadoop_master. You can also just run those scripts' commands manually.

You'll need to format the namenode and then restart the namenode (@sudo service hadoop-0.20-namenode restart@)
