h2. Overview

ClusterChef will help you create a scalable, efficient compute cluster in the cloud. It has recipes for Hadoop, Cassandra, NFS and more -- use as many or as few as you like. For example, you can create and:

* A small 1-5 node cluster for development or just to play around with Hadoop or Cassandra
* A spot-priced, ebs-backed cluster for unattended computing at rock-bottom prices
* A large 30+ machine cluster with multiple EBS volumes per node running Hadoop and Cassandra, with optional NFS for

h3. Advantages

* With Chef, you declare a final state for each node, not a procedure to follow. Adminstration is more efficient, robust and maintainable.
* You get a nice central dashboard to manage clients
* You can easily roll out configuration changes across all your machines
* Chef is actively developed and has well-written recipes for webservers, databases, development tools, and a ton of different software packages.
* Poolparty makes creating amazon cloud machines concise and easy: you can specify spot instances, ebs-backed volumes, disable-api-termination, and more.
