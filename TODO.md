### seamless stop-start support

* chef-client on bootup
  - when you stop/start machines their IP address changes, so must reconverge


* create chef node for me

* chef needs to converge twice on hadoop master

* dirs are fucked up under natty beause paths are /dev/xvdi not /dev/sdi


### Minor quibbles

* NFS server boostrapping
  - need to upgrade kernel, restart
